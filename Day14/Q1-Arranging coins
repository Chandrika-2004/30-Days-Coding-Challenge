Q : You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

public:
    int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        int l = 0 , h = n;
        while(l <= h) {
            long mid = l + (h - l) / 2;
            if (n >= (mid * (mid + 1) / 2)) l = mid + 1;
            else h = mid - 1;
        } 
        return l - 1;
    }
};
