Q : Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear
as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order

Sol :

Python :

from collections import Counter

class Solution(object):
    def intersect(self, nums1, nums2):
        counts = Counter(nums1)
        result = []

        for num in nums2:
            if counts[num] > 0:
                result.append(num)
                counts[num] -= 1

        return result
