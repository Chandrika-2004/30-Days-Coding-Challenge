Q : Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        res = 0

        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            
            l = dfs(root.left)
            r = dfs(root.right)

            nonlocal res
            res = max(res, l + r)

            return 1 + max(l, r)

        dfs(root)
        return res
