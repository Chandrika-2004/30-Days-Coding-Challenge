Q :Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Sol:
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        zero = one = two = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n == 0:
                zero += 1
            elif n == 1:
                one += 1
            else:
                two += 1

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if zero > 0:
                nums[i] = 0
                zero -= 1
            elif one > 0:
                nums[i] = 1
                one -= 1
            else:
                nums[i] = 2
                two -= 1
