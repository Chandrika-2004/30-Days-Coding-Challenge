Q : Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

Sol:

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++){
            if((n >> i) & 1) {
                res += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
