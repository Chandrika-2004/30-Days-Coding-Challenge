Q : 
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.


Sol:

class Solution{
    public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        set<int> st;

        while (true) {
            int sum = 0;
            while (n != 0) {
                int digit = n % 10;
                sum += digit * digit;  
                n /= 10;
            }
            if (sum == 1) return true;   
            if (st.count(sum)) return false; 

            st.insert(sum);  
            n = sum;         
        }
    }
};
